  #compare
    %h2 How does this compare to...?

    %p
      There are loads of great proprietary transactional email services out there. If you're happy spending
      the money then take a look at #{link_to "Sendgrid", "http://sendgrid.com/"},
      #{link_to "Mailgun", "http://www.mailgun.com/"} and #{link_to "Mandrill", "http://mandrill.com/"}.
      These are just a few of them..

    %p
      It's still early days for Cuttlefish and even now it already does a chunk of the most important things
      the proprietary services do. Cuttlefish offers basic bounce email handling, ensuring you maintain your
      good mail reputation by not resending to bounced addresses. Cuttlefish also gives you insight on how
      people read and respond to your emails via automatic open and click tracking.

    %p
      Of course there is a lot that Cuttlefish doesn't yet do that the proprietary services do.
      It doesn't handle incoming email; It
      can't detect when a user marks one of your emails as spam; It doesn't have built in support for email
      templates.

  .beta
    %h2 Beta but battle hardened
    %p
      Cuttlefish is in <em>beta</em>. It's been used in production by
      #{link_to "OpenAustralia Foundation", "http://www.openaustraliafoundation.org.au"}'s projects for several years
      and has sent many millions of emails.
